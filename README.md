# CFB Risk Team Dashboard
[This website](https://shen3340.github.io/cfb-risk-team-dashboard/) was created using React through Typescript as a way for me to improve my understanding of the framework and the language. It serves as a better alternative to the [College Football Risk Shiny App (currently archived)](https://shen3340.shinyapps.io/Teams/).

Some relevant features it supports for the game [College Football Risk](https://collegefootballrisk.com/):

•MVP players: This will output every player that won MVP for your team this roll.

•Legal moves: This will output every territory your team can legally attack or defend for the following turn.

•Odds: This will output an image of the odds for every team territory.
